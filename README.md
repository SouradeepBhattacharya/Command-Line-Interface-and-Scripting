# Command-Line-Interface-and-Scripting

This repository contains my solutions for the graded lab assignment covering modules 5 – 10. Each question is solved with a shell script or C program, and every solution lives in its own folder under lab_assignment/. Alongside each script/program you’ll find sample input files (where appropriate) and an explanation.txt file that shows the exact commands run, the output produced, and a brief explanation of what the script does.


## How to run the scripts and programs
Clone or download this repository.
<br />Navigate to the lab_assignment/QuestionX directory for the question you want to test.
<br />For the shell scripts (Questions 1–8):
<br />Make the script executable (if necessary) using chmod +x script_name.sh.
<br />Run the script according to the instructions in explanation.txt—this file shows sample commands and the expected output. The scripts use standard Bash and GNU utilities.
<br />For the C programs (Questions 9 and 10):
<br />Compile each program using a C compiler, e.g.

<br />gcc -o zombie_prevention zombie_prevention.c
<br />gcc -o signal_demo signal_demo.c


<br />Run the resulting executables (./zombie_prevention, ./signal_demo). See the explanation.txt files in those folders for sample runs and expected output.
<br />Review the explanation.txt in each question folder to understand what each command does and to verify that your output matches the expected behavior.
