Command: ./validate_results.sh
Explanation: The script reads marks.txt line by line, splitting on commas. It trims whitespace and checks each subject's score against the passing mark (33). Students who fail exactly one subject are printed and counted, as are those who pass all subjects. Others are ignored. The results are also written to separate files (failed_one.txt and passed_all.txt).
Output:
Students who failed in exactly one subject:
102 - Bob
103 - Charlie

Students who passed in all subjects:
101 - Alice
104 - Diana

Summary:
Count of students who failed exactly one subject: 2
Count of students who passed in all subjects: 2
