Command: gcc -o zombie_prevention zombie_prevention.c && ./zombie_prevention
Explanation: The C program forks three child processes. Each child prints its PID and exits immediately. The parent process waits for each child using `wait()`, which cleans up the child's exit status and prevents zombies. The parent prints the PID of each cleaned up child. After all children are reaped, no zombie processes remain.

Sample output (actual PIDs will vary):
Child process 1 (PID=12345) started, exiting now.
Child process 2 (PID=12346) started, exiting now.
Child process 3 (PID=12347) started, exiting now.
Parent cleaned up child with PID 12345
Parent cleaned up child with PID 12346
Parent cleaned up child with PID 12347
All children have been reaped. No zombie processes remain.
