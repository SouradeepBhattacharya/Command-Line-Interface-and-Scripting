Command: ./emailcleaner.sh
Explanation: The script reads emails.txt and uses an extended regular expression to match valid emails of the form letters/digits, followed by '@', followed by only letters, ending with '.com'. It writes valid emails to valid.txt after sorting and removing duplicates. Other entries are written to invalid.txt.
Output:
Valid email addresses have been saved to 'valid.txt'.
Invalid email addresses have been saved to 'invalid.txt'.

Contents of valid.txt:
123@letters.com
Alice123@company.com
coolguy123@cool.com
repeat@domain.com
user1@example.com

Contents of invalid.txt:
